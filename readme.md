# Bear Watcher
This project introduced us to JavaScript modules and built on all previous material. The user is presented with a single screen that asks for an input for a name and image. Submitting, once the program has confirmed that both boxes have been filled out, generates a card in the box comprising the lower portion of the screen. The idea here was for visual simplicity and cleanliness, so that box's overflow is set to allow the user to scroll once enough cards are present so as to maintain the same visual workspace that the user sees on load.
